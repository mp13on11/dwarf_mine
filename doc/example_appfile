# Example MPI appfile
# 
# This is an example MPI configuration using 4 physical machines, with 3 of 
# them having CUDA-capable hardware. On each of these, a process is started 
# for each elf implementation (CUDA or SMP).
#
# "/path/to/executable" has to be equal on all machines - if it isn't, the
# correct path has to be specified for each host.
